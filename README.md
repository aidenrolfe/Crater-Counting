# Using crater counting to determine the age of the moon

MATLAB code used to count craters on an image of the moon and interpolate an age from the relative cratering count.

Moon images can be taken from --> https://quickmap.lroc.asu.edu/

`pixeldens` parameter can be changed based on the distance per pixel of the input image (which can be found on LROC).
